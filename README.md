Forked this for personal use and added/changed some things here and there:
- custom red Danbooru-based theme
- changed Autocomplete extension to load current theme's css last (currently dirty since it results in theem's stylesheet being loaded twice, but mkay)
- changed home page extension to allow for configurable logo and logo link
- changed index.php's site title behavior to also be configurable with a logo and custom logo link
